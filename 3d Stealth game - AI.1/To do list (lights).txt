Create a light (Anything but directional)
Add lightlevel variable to player
Scan around player for lights with tag 'Light' (static lights, on walls not moving)
if you find one, read in (lightlevel + distance (vector3.distance(light.transform, player.transform,x))
-some sort of calculation 
make it so guard can read this new player variable
if guard to player < light level 
see player?
